## Project Overview

The Rust Strategic Operations Platform is a comprehensive suite of tools and applications designed for strategic operations management in Rust gaming environments. This platform consists of three main components, each serving specific operational needs.

## Architecture

### üé® Rust Base Design Studio
A web-based design and planning tool for creating strategic layouts, maps, and operational plans. Features include:
- Interactive map editor with drag-and-drop functionality
- Shape and object management system
- Real-time collaboration tools
- Export capabilities for operational planning

**Technology Stack:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Express.js server
- PostgreSQL database integration
- CORS-enabled API endpoints

### üéØ Rust Tactical Command Center
A React-based tactical operations interface providing real-time monitoring and command capabilities. Features include:
- Real-time data visualization
- Interactive dashboards
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI components
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Express.js backend

### üñ•Ô∏è Rust Server Operations Center
A comprehensive server monitoring and management system with advanced analytics and BattleMetrics integration. Features include:
- Real-time server monitoring
- BattleMetrics API integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- File upload and management
- Google Cloud Storage integration

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Platform integration
- BattleMetrics API integration
- Express.js backend with session management

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS version recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (requires authorization)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarkBojeHording/Rust-Strategic-Operations-Platform.git
   cd Rust-Strategic-Operations-Platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for each component**
   ```bash
   # Base Design Studio
   cd "Rust Base Design Studio"
   npm install
   
   # Tactical Command Center
   cd "../Rust Tactical Command Center"
   npm install
   
   # Server Operations Center
   cd "../Rust Server Operations Center"
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` files to `.env` in each component directory
   - Configure database connections and API keys
   - Set up Google Cloud credentials (for Server Operations Center)

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # For components using Drizzle ORM
   npm run db:push
   ```
